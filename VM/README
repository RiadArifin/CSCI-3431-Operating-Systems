This directory contains the memory manager with no page replacement - the 
size of virtual and physical memory is the same.

The task directory contains the implementation that has
a smaller amount of physical memory, and therefore requires a page
replacement once available memory has been allocated. Your task is to implement LRU
via stack and time stamp. Provide the statistics such as page fault rate and TLB hit rate in the report.

To test a solution, run the following testing script:

	./test.sh
