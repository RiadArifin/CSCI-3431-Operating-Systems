# CSCI-3431-Operating-Systems
Assignment 4 of Operating System course (CSCI 3431) at SMU. the task is to design a virtual memory manager.

Learning goals include:

-understanding the steps involved in translating logical to physical addresses.

-resolving page faults using demand paging and managing a TLB.

-implementation of page-replacement algorithms.

An example code is given in 'VM/example' directory. The example code considers equal sized virtual and physical memory.
The students are required to implement LRU page replacement algorithm ( via stack and counters). Learn the skeleton code provided under 
'VM/task' directory and implement the LRU algorithm. More details can be found in 'Assignment4.docx'.
